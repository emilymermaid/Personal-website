Hi! My name is Ngai Keung (Oliver) Chan. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Communication](https://communication.cals.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). I study the role of algorithms in transforming labor processes in the digitally-enabled gig economy. Using qualitative methods, I focus on how digitally-enabled service workers encounter, interpret, and manage algorithmic performance metrics (e.g., ratings, rankings, reviews, etc.) as part of their daily work practices. 

My dissertation project "Fighting Algorithmic Metrics: A Multi-Case Study of Labor Control and Resistance in the Gig Economy" is a qualitative multi-case study of digitally-enabled serivce workers' practices. It aims to unravel the power dynamics underlying the production, interpretation, and uses of algorithmic performance metrics across on-demand labor platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, etc.). It aims to offers a comparative perspective of the politics of algorithmic metrics in digital service workplaces. 

In addition to my doctoral research, I am interested in studying the politics of urban space and social movements (with a particular geographic focus on Hong Kong, my hometown). Before coming to Cornell, I spent a year of fieldwork in a multi-ethnic street market in Hong Kong, studying hawkers' precarious work practices. I have also collaborated on research projects concerning the production and appropriation of public spaces for collective actions in Hong Kong.

My research has appeared in such journals as *New Media & Society*, *Communication, Culture & Critique*, *Surveillance & Society*, *Media and Communication*, and *Space and Culture*, among others.
